Reading Notes:
-When a function is not defined, it is within a block(a series of statements inside {}).
-Non-primitive data types return 'object'.
-use 'const' and 'let' to declare variables.
-'const' and 'let' are block scoped variables.
-for a global variable don't use 'let' or 'const'.
-hex, octal and binary are supported in ES6.
-arrays has operations similar to stack.
-Ternary operators are better than an if-else statement.
-Infinite loops are especially bad in public facing code.
-For-Of loops can be used to loop over an array.
-Sets and maps are enumerable, so can also be looped over using a for-of loop.
-A callback is a function that is provided as an argument to another function.
