This week I worked a lot on the team activity to get that working properly.
2. What am I going to do next?
Next, I will be doing more of the sandbox exercises as well, I hope to 
work on the team activity before Tuesday's class to better prepare for the 
activity with me group.
3. What are my blockers?
My blockers this week will be understanding the reading and new assignments
as I struggled to pick up last weeks concepts very quickly.

Reading Questions:
Is it always better to use strict mode?
Should alerts be avoided when possible?
Is it better to use a throw or try/catch?
Should feature detection always be used?

Reading Notes:
-exceptions are errors that produce a return value to help 
error handle.
-strict mode can help warn of deprecated js code in the program.
-Alerts are to be used as breakpoints 
-console.trace() can be used to track the functions that were called
before an exception was thrown.
-Debugger command can be used to show the value of variables within
a function.
-finally can be used after try/catch to be executed after the try or catch
-Jest is made to help TDD
