W02 Reading Notes, Questions and Report

Report:
1. What did I do since the last meeting?
This week I focused on improving my understanding of ES and working with the arrays.  I also focused on helping my group by talking 
through things rather than just quietly following along with the assignment.
2. What am I going to do next?
This week I will complete more of the sandbox code as well as get ahead on the reading to be better prepared for the activities rather 
than reading after the lecture sessions. 
3. What are my blockers?
My blockers this week will be time management with the amount of reading and ensuring I dedicate enough time to completing the 
sandbox activities for the week.

Reading Questions:
Is there another object reference, similar to 'this'?
Is it better to use dot notation or bracket when calling a method?
When should you use the Math over using your own calculations built in locally?
Is it better to use jQuery or regular dot notation to access elements?
Is inline event or listeners more functional to use?

Reading Notes:
-var should be avoided because it doesn't always die within the block it is created in.
-let is preferred to avoid memory leaking.
-use ticks to build html functions for output
-this is an unboud way to reference a variable
-ES6 has a shorthand way to create objects: object name = {name, realName};
-properties that don't exist are undefined
-JSON.parse() will convert a string to a JS object
-JSON.stringify() does the opposite of above
-Math, Date, RegExp are all built in
-jQuery can help to retrieve DOM elements.
-avoid touchstart as it causes a lot of false positives
-swipes are made with touchstart, touchmove, and touchleave events
