W08 Reading Notes, Questions and Report

Report:
1. What did I do since the last meeting?
I worked on my team assignment and added some things to my to do app. I also worked to remove jquery from the app to 
ensure I built it all on my own.
2. What am I going to do next?
This week I will work to master the transform and transitions on the js. Also I plan to meet all the stretch goals with my group.
3. What are my blockers?
My blockers this week are understanding the new material and ensuring my callback funtions are working properly.


Reading Questions:
Is it better to use an async function or .then?
When should const be used over let in a url string?
Should transform be used before transition?
Is transition to be used in parent class?

Reading Notes:
-use transition in css to make changes to html doc
-transition goes in the base state
-transform can be used in @keyframes
-use transform-origin to alter where the transform occurs.
-keep the css in there as much as possible and use the js to implement classes and do simple things
