Reading Questions:
When does the defer tag need to be left off?
Do you only need a this.function call when the function definition is within the class?


Reading Notes:
-defer tag must be used to download js file to the page before loading the rest of the page.
-Non default export uses export before the function tag and definition.
-use 'import{function1, function2} from 'directory/file.js'' to import one of the module exports.
-to use the import keyword, must add 'type="module"' to the script tag.
-Modules are automatically deferred.
-must use this.function to call a function in the scope of the class, otherwise it will look for global function.
