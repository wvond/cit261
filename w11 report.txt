W11 Reading Notes, Questions and Report

Report:
1. What did I do since the last meeting?
I received an API key from the website and I built some of the website design to prepare for the search features.
2. What am I going to do next?
This week I will look at the API documentation and add that to receive the JSON data and display it on the page.
3. What are my blockers?
My blockers this week will be getting the API to return and implementing the proper filtering of that data to show
what the users wants to see.
