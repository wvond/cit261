W10 Reading Notes, Questions and Report

Report:
1. What did I do since the last meeting?
I decided on my project and I figured out how I am going to access the API.
2. What am I going to do next?
Next, I will follow my plan to begin my project and meet the checkpoints in my proposal
as well as working on the team activity with my group remotely this week.
3. What are my blockers?
My blockers will be finding a time to meet with my group but other than that I should be able
to do get a lot of my project done next week.


Reading Questions:
Is there a way to wait to call the api until the form is submitted?
Does css default to the regular style if there is :invalid but no :valid?
Is the Constraint Validation API required for client side?
Should the credentials: 'omit' always be used when you don't want to send credentials?
Can you only use POST to upload files?


Reading Notes:

-use .gitignore to not upload sensitive or large files to github
-use export to make the module reusable
-controller connect model and view as the glue between them
-strings are similar to an array and have a .length property
-html5 has built in type for form validation
-pattern="reg expression" will allow inline validation
-js .setCustomValidity can customize error messages
-display explicit error messages
-be permissive about the input format
-point out exactly where the error occurs, especially on large forms
-fetch returns a promise resolved normally even if its a 404 or 500 res
-fetch blocks cross site cookies
-fetch won't send cookies unless included with credentials init option
