W12 Reading Notes, Questions and Report

Report:
1. What did I do since the last meeting?
I used the new API key to begin calling searches for nearby schools using either a city or a geoLocation call.
2. What am I going to do next?
This week I will finish getting the API data to display on the site and allow the user to specify search criteria.
3. What are my blockers?
My blockers this week will be displaying the data properly and being able to get the correct data as requested by the user.
